            <p>I am writing this as my finals grade for a linguistics course just dropped and made me speechless for a good half hour. I realized I just completed my first quarter at UW. As someone who left a cushy tech job (with an exponential growth curve) back in India for my Master's, I felt it was important for me to write everything down. I wanted to be grateful about the things that worked for me, rant about those that didn't, and simmer in deep thought about everything in between.</p>

            <h2>What didn't work for me</h2>
            
            <p>There isn't a lot for me to put into the basket of "achievements" from this quarter. I was briefly interested in pursuing AI Safety and I was rejected from all programs I applied to - MATS, SPAR, CHAI summer 2026 internship.</p>
